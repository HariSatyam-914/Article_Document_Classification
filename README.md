# 📚 Article_Document_Classification

**Overview**

Welcome to the Article & Document Classification project! This system leverages the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically classify and organize large volumes of text into predefined categories. 🧠🚀

Imagine you have thousands of documents, and you need to sort them into categories like Sports, Technology, or Health. Instead of going through them manually, this project automates the process, saving you tons of time! ⏳📁

**Features ✨**

Automatic Classification: Efficiently classifies articles and documents into predefined categories. 📚➡️🗂️

NLP-Powered: Uses machine learning and natural language processing techniques for accurate text analysis and categorization. 🔍💬

Customizable: Modify categories to fit any domain (news, academic papers, reviews, etc.). 🎨

Scalable: Handles large datasets of documents seamlessly. 📈

**How It Works 🧠**

Data Input: Feeds the system with articles or documents (in text format).

Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes the text, removing irrelevant elements (like stop words).

Feature Extraction: Extracts meaningful features using techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings, or BERT.

Model Prediction: Classifies the document using machine learning models like Naive Bayes, SVM, or Deep Learning.

Result: Outputs the category to which the document belongs.

**Use Cases 🌟**

News Aggregation: Automatically group news articles into categories such as politics, sports, and entertainment.

Document Management: Organize corporate or academic documents into various departments or subjects.

Sentiment Analysis: Use classification for categorizing reviews, customer feedback, or surveys into positive, negative, or neutral.

**Quick Start 🚀**

Prerequisites

Python 3.x 🐍

Required Libraries: NLTK, scikit-learn, spaCy, TensorFlow, etc.
